ARt : AR mapping
----------------

**Virtual Interaction and design group project (1st Year of Master degree in Universite Paris-Saclay)**


ARt is an Augmented Reality Android mobile application, developed using Unity 3D, Vuforia SDK and Android Studio. 



If you want to buy a painting or a sculpture or center piece for your tea table from an artist across the world, 
you can do so online through several e-commerce websites that sells art works. 

But how do you decide, if the painting goes well with the interiors of your house ? How big would the art work be on your wall ? ARt is the one stop solution, which lets you virtually view the painting on your wall with its actual size and 
see how that center piece looks on your corner table or see how well the garden sculpture goes with the landscape of your front yard !
